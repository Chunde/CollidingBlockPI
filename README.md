# Description

This jupyter notebook was intend to study the relation betweem block colliding and the constant PI, I was trying to demostrate thier relation via simulation using Python language. the goal is to prove it mathematically which has been done by others but I would like to try it myself and play a bit more, enjoy the brainstorm.
There may be deeper connection to the underlying law of nature if you dar to believe.

* you may check out the video on Youtube explain more about this code https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR-y-OvXfU4

# 问题描述
这个笔记本是用来试图通过程序模拟来更好地理解弹性碰撞与圆周率的神秘关系，这个关系已经被证明了，不过我的目的是要自己慢慢去理解，或者还有更深层次的自然规律，只要你敢去想象，这个代码有中英文注释，方便国内外的观众理解。
